# Amazon-Clone
🚀 Amazon Clone UI – Built with HTML & CSS! 🏢💻

🌟 Features:

✅ Static Design – Modeled closely after Amazon’s layout
✅ CSS Styling & Layouts – Using Flexbox & Grid for structuring
✅ Organized Code – Well-structured and easy to understand

🔥 Challenges & Learnings:
One of the biggest challenges was replicating the Amazon UI using just HTML & CSS. This project helped me strengthen my CSS skills, including positioning, Flexbox, and Grid.

🚀 Future Improvements:
